"""Tests for ActorHandler — fetch an actor, stamp the node, enqueue collections.

handle fetches the actor via the signed client, adds/enriches the graph node
with scalar metadata + a last_fetch_date stamp, and enqueues a `collection` job
for each of followers/following (carrying the actor's depth). It enqueues
collections UNCONDITIONALLY — every node, including leaves, gets its counts; the
depth bound that stops page-walking lives in CollectionHandler now, not here.
Dedup: a node already stamped with last_fetch_date is skipped (no fetch/enqueue).

Pure DI unit tests: a fake async client, a recording FakeDispatcher, a FakeGraph.

Assumed contract (flag if different):
  ActorHandler(client, dispatcher, graph).handle(job)
    job = {job_type:'actor', actor_id, depth}
    if node has last_fetch_date -> return (skip)
    actor = await client.get(actor_id); stamp node with scalar metadata + last_fetch_date
    enqueue a collection job for followers and following:
      {job_type:'collection', collection_id:<url>, owner_id:actor_id,
       direction:'followers'|'following', depth:<actor's depth>}
