"""Tests for snapshot — write a Graph out as GML.

snapshot iterates a Graph (all_nodes -> (id, label, props), all_edges ->
(from_id, to_id, props)) and writes a GML file: each node an integer `id` + a
`label` string + its scalar properties, each edge `source`/`target` by id + its
properties. The transaction is the caller's (main()), so snapshot needs only the
graph + a path — a FakeGraph drives it with no DB or connection.

The output is verified by reading it back with networkx (how the real snapshot is
consumed): an invalid file fails to parse rather than silently mis-asserting, and
networkx keys nodes by their `label`, resolving edge source/target ids to those
labels.
