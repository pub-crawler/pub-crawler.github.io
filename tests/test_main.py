"""Tests for main.crawl_graph (step 2) — seeds file -> nodes-only GML.

Black-box: crawl_graph reads webfinger addresses (one per line), resolves each
to an actor id, builds a graph of those nodes, and writes it to the output path
(created or replaced). The queue/runner are internal. A single httpx.MockTransport
serves the webfinger lookups; the graph is read back with networkx to assert.

Assumed contract:
  async crawl_graph(input_filename, output_filename, *, transport=None)
    -> writes a GML graph whose nodes are the resolved actor ids
  Blank/whitespace lines are ignored; a seed that fails to resolve is skipped
  (the run continues); the output file is created or replaced.
