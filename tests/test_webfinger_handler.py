"""Tests for WebfingerHandler (step 4) — resolve a seed acct, enqueue its actor.

Step-4 contract: handle resolves the webfinger address to an actor id, adds it
to the graph as a bare node (no attrs — ActorHandler stamps those later), and
enqueues an actor job at depth 0.

Pure unit tests via DI: a fake async webfinger client, a recording
FakeDispatcher (jobs land in a list), a FakeGraph. No HTTP.
