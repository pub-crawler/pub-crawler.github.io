"""Tests for WebfingerHandler (step 1) — resolve a seed acct, add a bare node.

Step-1 contract: handle resolves the webfinger address to an actor id and adds
it to the graph as a node with the actor id ONLY — no attributes (no
last_fetch_date; it hasn't been fetched, ActorHandler stamps that later). It
does NOT enqueue yet (that arrives in step 4).

Pure unit tests via DI: a fake async webfinger client, a spy queue that would
record any enqueue, and a real networkx DiGraph. No HTTP.
