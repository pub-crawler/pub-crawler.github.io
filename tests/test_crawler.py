"""Integration test for crawler — seed a queue, drain it, check the graph.

Drives the REAL wiring: make_dispatcher() builds the dispatcher with all four
handlers; crawl_graph() runs the worker pool until the queue drains. A
MockTransport serves a shallow crawl (webfinger -> actor -> count-only
collections), a FakeAsyncRedis backs the queue, and a FakeGraph receives the
handlers' writes — so we assert the graph the crawl actually built. (GML output
is test_snapshot's job, not this one.)

Assumed contract (flag if different):
  make_dispatcher(redis, graph, *, transport=None) -> Dispatcher
      (counters, clients, all four handlers registered — the test passes a
       redis-y thing, a graph-y thing, and a transport-y thing; the rest is
       crawler.py's to build)
  async crawl_graph(dispatcher)
      creates the worker pool, drains the queue (join), winds the workers down
